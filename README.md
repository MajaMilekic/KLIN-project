This repository contains data and [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index) code for project on [Clinical Engineering](http://automatika.etf.rs/sr/13e054kli) course at the [University of Belgrade - School of Electrical Engineering](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en#gsc.tab=0) in 2020/21 school year.

[Electromyography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography) (EMG) signals were measured from four healthy subjects ID1-ID4 (3 females and one male) from the muscle *biceps brachii* on the right arm. In addition to EMG, elbow angle with goniometer was measured too. All subjects signed Informed Consent according to the Code of Ethics of the [University of Belgrade](http://www.bg.ac.rs/en/) for studies involving human subjects which is also in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
